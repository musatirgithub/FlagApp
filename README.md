<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've made a Flags App.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The main goal of the project was to make an API request,</li>
  <li>In this project, I've made API request by using Fetch method, </li>
  <li>I also used my Fetch method within an async function,</li>
  <li>I used a datalist input and sorted country names before placing them into datalist,</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below ðŸ‘‡. </li>
  <li>Hope you like my project!</li>
  <li>All comments and contributions are welcomed!</li>
